# Hello World!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm FJ, and this is where I'll be sharing my adventures in tech, thoughts on development, and probably too many opinions about Software Engineering.

## The Origin Story (Because Every Developer Needs One)

Like many developers, my journey started with the classic "Hey, can you build me a website?" from a friend. Little did I know that saying "yes" would lead me down a rabbit hole of PHP frameworks, from Joomla to Symfony, and eventually to a full-blown career in software development. It's like they say: come for the quick WordPress fix, stay for the lifetime of debugging.

## Jack of All Trades, Master of... Actually, Quite a Few

Over the past decade, I've had my hands in pretty much everything tech-related. Think of me as a tech Swiss Army knife, but instead of tools, I've got programming languages and frameworks. From building queue management systems with Raspberry Pi (because apparently, I enjoy making printers work, which is a special kind of masochism) to crafting SaaS applications that actually made it to production, I've done a bit of everything.

One of my proudest moments? Creating an application to help prevent childhood blindness.

## The Migration: From dot net to javascript ecosystem

About five years ago, I made the switch from .NET to Node.js and TypeScript. It was very exciting to learn a new language and ecosystem, and I've been loving it ever since.

## Current Status: Leveling Up

Recently, I've been on a brief pause due to spinal surgery (turns out sitting at a desk for 12 hours straight for years isn't great for your back â€“ who knew?). But like any good developer, I'm using this downtime to level up my skills and finally wrap up my Computer Science degree. Because apparently, four programming languages weren't enough â€“ I needed to add concurrent programming in C, Python, and Go to the mix.

## What to Expect From This Blog

Here's what you'll find in this little digital garden of mine:

- Technical deep-dives that won't put you to sleep.
- Stories from the trenches of full-stack development.
- IoT adventures and misadventures.
- Docker tips that might save your sanity.
- Occasional rants about JavaScript frameworks (because someone has to do it).

## Let's Connect!

Whether you're here to learn, share experiences, or just enjoy some tech humor, I'm glad you stopped by. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about development, need help with a project, or just want to debate the merits of different Docker base images (Alpine vs. Debian, anyone?).

Stay tuned for more posts! And remember: in software development, it's all about finding the perfect balance... kind of like my attempts at work-life balance, which mostly consists of debugging code at 3 AM while convincing myself that coffee is a food group.

_P.S. No Docker containers were harmed in the making of this blog post._

_Disclaimer: This blog post was probably written after drinking too much coffee, and it was written by Claude, so don't take it too seriously._
