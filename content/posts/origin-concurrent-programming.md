# The origin of concurrent programming üï∞Ô∏è

In the early days of computing, programs ran sequentially - one instruction after another, in a strictly linear fashion. This worked well enough when computers could only run one program at a time. However, as computers became more powerful and the need to handle multiple users and tasks grew, a new approach was needed. This is where concurrent programming began to emerge.

## The Birth of Time-Sharing Systems üïê

The concept of concurrent programming largely originated with the development of time-sharing operating systems in the early 1960s. Before this, computers used batch processing systems where programs were executed one at a time in sequence. This was inefficient - while a program was waiting for I/O operations (like reading from tape or printing output), the expensive CPU sat idle.
This approach led to the development of **multiprogramming** - the ability to have multiple programs loaded into memory at once, with the CPU switching between them. When one program was waiting for I/O, the CPU could work on another program instead of sitting idle. This was a significant improvement in efficiency, as expensive computer time was no longer wasted during I/O operations.

The **Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS)**, developed at MIT in 1961, was one of the first operating systems to implement time-sharing. It allowed multiple users to interact with the computer simultaneously by rapidly switching between their programs. This was a revolutionary concept at the time - instead of waiting hours or days for your program to run in the batch queue, you could get immediate feedback.

### Key Innovations of Early Time-Sharing Systems üîë

1. **Process Management**: The ability to suspend and resume program execution, switching between different users' programs.
2. **Memory Protection**: Preventing programs from interfering with each other's memory space.
3. **Interrupt Handling**: Managing hardware events and I/O operations without blocking the entire system.
4. **Scheduling**: Deciding which program should run next and for how long.

## The Multics Project and Beyond üåü

Building on the success of CTSS, the **Multics** (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) project began in 1964. This ambitious project introduced many concepts we take for granted today:

- **Virtual Memory**: Allowing programs to use more memory than physically available
- **Protection Rings**: Different levels of system access for security
- **Dynamic Linking**: Loading program components as needed
- **Shared Memory**: Allowing multiple processes to share data

While Multics itself was considered too complex and expensive for widespread adoption, its ideas heavily influenced future operating systems, particularly Unix.

## The Theoretical Foundations üìö

As these practical systems were being developed, computer scientists were working to understand the theoretical foundations of concurrent programming:

- **Edsger Dijkstra** introduced the concept of semaphores in 1965, providing a way to coordinate between concurrent processes.
- **Tony Hoare** developed the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) formalism in 1978, which influenced languages like Go.
- **Per Brinch Hansen** and **C.A.R. Hoare** worked on monitors and other synchronization primitives.

### Early Challenges ü§î

The introduction of concurrent programming brought new challenges that developers had never faced before:

- **Race Conditions**: When multiple processes access shared resources simultaneously
- **Deadlocks**: When processes are stuck waiting for each other
- **Priority Inversion**: When a high-priority task is indirectly preempted by a lower-priority task

These problems led to the development of various synchronization primitives and programming patterns that we still use today.

## The Impact on Modern Computing üí´

The early work on concurrent programming in the 1960s laid the foundation for modern computing. Today's smartphones can run dozens of apps simultaneously, web servers handle thousands of concurrent connections, and cloud systems orchestrate millions of concurrent processes across distributed networks.

The fundamental concepts developed during this era continue to influence how we think about and implement concurrent systems:

- **Process Abstraction**: Treating concurrent tasks as independent entities
- **Resource Sharing**: Managing access to shared system resources
- **Communication**: Coordinating between concurrent processes
- **Protection**: Ensuring safety and security in concurrent environments

As we move forward in this series, we'll see how these early innovations evolved into the concurrent programming models and patterns we use today. The challenges faced by those early pioneers are still relevant, though the scale and complexity of our systems have grown dramatically.
